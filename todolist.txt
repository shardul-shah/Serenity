TODO #1: how do I make it so when I spam click on the play/pause button, since my mouse is technically still on the button, it shows the hover styled button for each play and pause? Right now it doesn't do that until I take my mouse away from the button and then click back on it.

TODO #2: Make an individual pause/play button for each sound (maybe).

TODO #3: Make master volume be controlled by main volume slider.

TODO #4: might be able to get away without var rain_sound = document.getElementById("rain_sound"); for each type of sound, as they are initialized in the HTML script code. And remove the many initialization statements.

TODO #5: maybe change script in HTML that initializes volumes to directly doing it like "IN HTML" on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onloadstart.asp 

TODO #6: Potentially implement more of Bootstrap & Grid into web application

TODO #7: Additional sliders which are in collapsible are not 100% width (not same width as the 1st slider, how to fix? And why is this?)

TODO #8: not perfect centering, how do I fix this??? Compare all the centers of the elements and observe the centers are not all alligned. 

TODO #9: Collapsible button loses hover after 1st click, how to fix this? (How can I make GlowEffect be displayed perm.?)

TODO #10: maybe instead of using fire, rain, thunder, etc, all the variables should be in a few arrays/dictionaries and the lists should be referred to directly for readability and clarity (using for loops to go through arrays)

TODO #11: Maybe change arrays into dictionaries for clarity in code, and actually use the arrays in code. 

TODO #12: Change all event handler functions of JS into 1 file and structure them in order of appearance in HTML.

TODO #13:
