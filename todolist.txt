Code Clarity TODO list:
TODO #12: Change all event handler functions of JS into 1 file and structure them in order of appearance in HTML.
TODO #11: Maybe change arrays into dictionaries for clarity in code, and actually use the arrays in code. 
TODO #10: maybe instead of using fire, rain, thunder, etc, all the variables should be in a few arrays/dictionaries and the lists should be referred to directly for readability and clarity (using for loops to go through arrays)
TODO #5: maybe change script in HTML that initializes volumes to directly doing it like "IN HTML" on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onloadstart.asp 


Future TODO list:
TODO #20: Add Fun Facts regarding relaxation, focus, elements, etc. etc. etc. 
TODO #23: Add reasoning/science behind sounds behind focus page as well. 
TODO #24: Make mute icons and element-type icons change colour on hover maybe. 
TODO #25: Maybe change the play/pause button from CSS based to font awesome icon based so it's more consistent and easier to work with. 
TODO #3: Make master volume be controlled by main volume slider (MAYBE MAKE ONE).
TODO #27: Add keyframes to windowScroll.js to hide button after the user scrolls too far up 
TODO #30: FIX CENTERING OF PAUSE/PLAY BUTTON
TODO #1: how do I make it so when I spam click on the play/pause button, since my mouse is technically still on the button, it shows the hover styled button for each play and pause? Right now it doesn't do that until I take my mouse away from the button and then click back on it.
TODO #17: How to hide the "Scroll Up" button AND allow it to transition at the same time? I can only do the latter; soln: KEYFRAMES SOLN TO HIDING COLLAPSIBLE BTN
