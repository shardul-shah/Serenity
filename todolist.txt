TODO #1: how do I make it so when I spam click on the play/pause button, since my mouse is technically still on the button, it shows the hover styled button for each play and pause? Right now it doesn't do that until I take my mouse away from the button and then click back on it.

TODO #3: Make master volume be controlled by main volume slider (MAYBE MAKE ONE); FUTURE TODO

TODO #4: might be able to get away without var rain_sound = document.getElementById("rain_sound"); for each type of sound, as they are initialized in the HTML script code. And remove the many initialization statements.

TODO #5: maybe change script in HTML that initializes volumes to directly doing it like "IN HTML" on this page: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onloadstart.asp 

TODO #10: maybe instead of using fire, rain, thunder, etc, all the variables should be in a few arrays/dictionaries and the lists should be referred to directly for readability and clarity (using for loops to go through arrays)

TODO #11: Maybe change arrays into dictionaries for clarity in code, and actually use the arrays in code. 

TODO #12: Change all event handler functions of JS into 1 file and structure them in order of appearance in HTML.

TODO #15: Fix how #inverse_Wave looks in Safari

TODO #16: Difference between my current <a> top button ^ and this: HTML: <a href="#" id="to_top" onclick="scrollTop()"> JS: 
function scrollTop() {
	document.body.scrollTop = 0; // For Safari
 	document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0; // For Chrome, Firefox, IE and Opera
}
?
