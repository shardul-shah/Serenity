# Serenity

Serenity is a web application that allows the user to concentrate, relax, or focus on tasks using various sound effects.
The app can be found here: https://shardul-shah.github.io/Serenity/. Using sound to enhance concentration or enable relaxation is a concept that has been growing in the past decade or so. 
There has been growing research on not just sound-based relaxation & concentration, but also the general benefits of sound effects and/or music on the human body and/or brain. An example of such research can be found here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-013-9341-8

# Roadmap
There are many new concepts and improvements to the web application which I plan to add in the near future. A full list can be found in the file "todolist.txt" above.
However, here is a summary of these ideas:

-Add "Research & Science" section
-Add "Fun Facts" section
-Add "Dark Mode" feature
-Making the web application *fully* responsive on devices like tablets and phones
-General improvements (both small and big) across the web application
