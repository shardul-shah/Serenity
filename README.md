# Serenity

Serenity is a web application that allows the user to concentrate, relax, or focus on tasks using various sound effects.
The app can be found [here](https://shardul-shah.github.io/Serenity/). Using sound to enhance concentration or enable relaxation is a concept that has been growing in the past decade or so. 
There has been growing research on not just sound-based relaxation & concentration, but also the general benefits of sound effects and/or music on the human body and/or brain. An example of such research can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-013-9341-8).

# Roadmap
There are many new concepts and improvements to the web application which I plan to add in the near future. A full list can be found in the file "todolist.txt" above.
However, here is a summary of these ideas:

1. Add "Research & Science" section.
2. Add "Fun Facts" section.
3. Add **Dark Mode** feature.
4. Making the web application *fully* responsive on devices like tablets and phones.
5. Add many more sound types.
6. Make the website *fully* follow the concepts of Web Accessibility (learn more about Web Accessibility [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).
7. General improvements (both small and big) across the web application, including bug fixes, code & app optimization, and code enhancement.
